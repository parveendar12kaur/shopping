# electrode-appconfig

This is a simple Hapi plugin to support app config related things.

It adds a new server extension to the `onRequest` lifecyle event that does:

  1. Set `request.app.config` to `server.app.config`
  2. Repair cookie that was messed up by some proxy or router
  
You have to enable repair cookie with option to the plugin.

```js
server.register( {
    register: require("@walmart/electrode-appconfig"),
    options: {
        repairCookie: true
    }
});
```
