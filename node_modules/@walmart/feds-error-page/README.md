# feds-error-page

It's an error page.

This component makes the assumption that you have the base CSS styles and Bogle and icon fonts available on the page.

## Installation

This package was created to prevent a circular dependency in some packages, such as `discovery-webapp` requiring `feds-ny-core` for `<ErrorPage>`. Since most apps implicitly get `feds-error-page` through a webapp package and won't import it directly, the Stylus file was also made available in `feds-ny-core`.

This file depends on variables from the [`lithe-extras` base styles](https://gecgithub01.walmart.com/electrode/lithe/blob/master/packages/lithe-extras/lib/tenants/new-york/base.styl) (e.g. `$xs-spacing`, `$blue-dark`, etc) which you will likely already have in your app.

```
npm install @walmart/feds-error-page
```
Once installed, import the following Stylus files into your app somewhere:

```styl
@require "~@walmart/lithe-extras/lib/tenants/new-york/base"; //you probably already have this in your app
@require "~@walmart/feds-error-page/src/styles/error-page";
```

This `.styl` file is also available in `@walmart/feds-ny-core`, in the case you aren't directly importing `@walmart/feds-error-page`:

```styl
@require "~@walmart/lithe-extras/lib/tenants/new-york/base"; //you probably already have this in your app
@require "~@walmart/feds-ny-core/src/error-page/styles/error-page";
```

The reason the Stylus file also exists in `@walmart/feds-ny-core` is that most apps get `feds-error-page` through a webapp package and will never import it directly. Since `feds-ny-core` is common amongst most apps, and since `<ErrorPage>` was originally part of `feds-ny-core`, the Stylus file was duplicated there to provide a common import point for the styles.

Any changes to the styles should also be made in the [`feds-ny-core` version](https://gecgithub01.walmart.com/FEDS/ny-core/blob/master/src/error-page/styles/error-page.styl) as well.
