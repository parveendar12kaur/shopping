# Electrode NPM Singleton

There are some modules that have to be a singleton install.

However, as development on different modules progress, their dependence on a singleton module may become out of sync, and causing NPM to install multiple versions of a singleton module.

This module helps a singleton module to enforce that requirement.

## Usage

Install

    $ npm install @walmart/electrode-npm-single --save

In your index.js or any of your JS files:

```js
require("@walmart/electrode-npm-single")(__dirname);
```

Be careful that in the JS files that's not in your module's top level, such as `lib/index.js`, you have to do:

```js
require("@walmart/electrode-npm-single")(`${__dirname}/..`);
```
