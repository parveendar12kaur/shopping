# Electrode Archetype Option SASS

Allow [Electrode](https://github.com/electrode-io/electrode) apps to optionally choose to skip installing dependencies for SASS.

The app can skip installing sass dependencies by adding a file `archetype/config/index.js` or `archetype/config.js` and set:

```js
module.exports = {
  options: {
    sass: false
  }
};
```

If nothing is set, then default is to install.

# Usage

This module generally is included by other Electrode modules. An Electrode app should not need to install this directly.

## Install

In `package.json`:

```js
{
  "optionalDependencies": {
    "electrode-archetype-opt-sass": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

And setup archetype config accordingly.
